# Summary

For my dataset this week, I decided to pick out 16 random Animal Crossing villagers to create data for. I use the randomizer below to pick out the villagers and filled out their data using Nookipedia's villager list. I themed the entire page around Animal Crossing, with an Animal Crossing background image and divs styles to match the aesthetic, and I was also hoping to include the Animal Crossing font, but that didn't pan out. Then I set the dataset up to display in a table in the main div.

## Issues

So I was really slow to get started this week because I struggled to understand all the pieces required for this assignment and how they all worked together; it really had nothing to do with the code itself, my brain just wasn't wanting to connect all the pieces together despite me looking through all the materials and, for the most part, understanding the process of creating each individual piece. I'm not sure how I managed to piece it altogether but I eventually did so and went on a pretty steady roll from there. I did have to look up a lot of extra details from outside sources, like how to set a background image, style a div, and change a font using jQuery, but they were easy to find once I understood what I was looking for.

There were a couple of things that I couldn't quite figure out or that I didn't have time to correct. I wanted to change the font of the page to Fink Heavy, which the font that Animal Crossing is known to use, but I tried a few different methods to add and use the font, to no avail. Secondly, for some reason all the info I called into the table got shoved into the one Name column instead of being separated into the four columns I created; I followed the example code on the course site but while that code works fine, mine is still messed up and I don't know why. I also realized after I was mostly done with the code that I hadn't included a JSON file, which might be why my data table isn't working, but I didn't have the time or energy to rewrite my entire code to accommodate and I still had another class's homework to do.

Regardless of the code's issues and with as much as I struggled just understanding this week's materials, I'm very happy with how far I got in it.
