# Summary

I was really excited for this week because I was familiar with a lot of the material already. After seeing the example codes in the course materials, I immediately came up with the idea to make a significantly easier version of the World's Hardest Game, which is an increasingly hard game with a very simple design. I wanted my game to be chill and colorful, so the colors I used to style by canvas and objects are light and bright, and the music I used for the audio is an "Oldies Playing in the Other Room While it Rains" playlist from one of my favorite YouTube channels, Nemo's Dreamscapes.
