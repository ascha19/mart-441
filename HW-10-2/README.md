# Summary

I was really excited for this week because I was familiar with a lot of the material already. After seeing the example codes in the course materials, I immediately came up with the idea to make a significantly easier version of the World's Hardest Game, which is an increasingly hard game with a very simple design. I wanted my game to be chill and colorful, so the colors I used to style by canvas and objects are light and bright, and the music I used for the audio is an "Oldies Playing in the Other Room While it Rains" playlist from one of my favorite YouTube channels, Nemo's Dreamscapes.

The plan was to make a "protagonist" character whose mission was to get to the goal on the other side of the canvas, while avoiding colliding with a moving barrier in the middle of the canvas. The player character was to move via WSAD while the barrier moved independently. Whenever the player hit the barrier, the background would turn red, the character would shrink, the barrier would grow in width, and the player would be reset to their beginning spot; after five failed attempts, the game would end and the canvas would turn black. If the character made it to the goal, the game would end as well, but with a green screen instead.

## Issues

My main issue this week was making my objects appear on the canvas at all and finding examples to reference that didn't involve jQuery because I choose to not use it if it's not a requirement of the assignment.

I also dealt with unnecessary syntax errors that wanted me to remove brackets that were important to the code.
