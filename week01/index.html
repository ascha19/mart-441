      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alec and I'm a junior, working towards my Bachelor's in Media Arts and a certification in Cybersecurity. I should be graduating in the next two years, maybe a year if I do classes during every semester, including summer and winter. I've been doing art for as long as I can remember (I made the background image of this site, actually) and have been crafting and customizing figurines for the past few years now. I've never professionally worked in an artistic field before but I plan to create a design portfolio this semester and use it to apply for jobs in a creative field this summer.

      <h1>What Makes me Unique?</h1>
      <p>I've been an artist for, quite literally, as long as I remember and I love to play with different types of design, so I pick up new mediums fairly quickly. I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades of art mediums; I've done everything from traditional sketching, to painting, to customizing, to jewelry-making, to woodwork.</p>
