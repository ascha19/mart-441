# Summary

This week, I wanted to make a slideshow of sorts, of pictures of Mr. Rogers Mister Rogers' Neighborhood and a few of his quotes, with my moving object being the Neighborhood Trolley. I was originally going to do three images and quotes but I ended up going with two. I cropped the images to be the size that I wanted and picked out a couple of my favorite Mr. Rogers quotes. I picked out a pale blue background to compliment the images and white div that I put the quotes in; I also made said divs have rounded corners for a softer look to fit the aesthetic.

Coding-wise, I looked up multiple ways to do what I wanted to but none of it worked and I'm not sure why. The one thing I managed to have success with was changing the first quote to the second with a click of a button.

## Issues

While the coding itself seemed fairly easy this week, I had a lot of issues with it. The main issues were that I couldn't figure out how to switch between images and make the trolley move. Despite troubleshooting the best I could and attempting various different ways of writing the functions I was trying to use, nothing seemed to work; I couldn't make the trolley move at all and sometimes the same image would fade out and back in or disappear altogether, but never switch to the next image. I initially struggled to change the text as well but managed to find a way to do so that worked. I couldn't figure out how to do this method with three quotes, though, so I narrowed my images and quotes down to two.

Even with the help I received, errors like making the trolley move and the images change didn't get resolved, so what I've turned in is how far I've gotten.
