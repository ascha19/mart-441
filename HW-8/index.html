    <p class="words" id="special">There would be no art, and there would be no science, if human beings had no desire to create. And if we had everything we ever needed or wanted, we would have no reason for creating anything. So, at the root of all art and all science there exists a gap--a gap between what the world is like and what we wish and hope for it to be like. Our unique way of bridging that gap in each of our lives seems to me to be the essence of the reason for human creativity. - Fred Rogers</p>
    <p class="words" id="special">"We don't have to think it's funny when we feel like we need some extra comfort. I sometimes sing about that to children, but, as you know, I believe there's a child somewhere in each of us. We all have times like that--times when an extra measure of care is needed. We need comfort and so does everyone else. And it's nothing to be ashamed of." - Fred Rogers</p>
    <p class="words" id="special">"Transitions are almost always signs of growth, but they can bring feelings of loss. To get somewhere new, we may have to leave somewhere else behind." - Fred Rogers</p>
