# The Experience

This week, I was physically and mentally unable to do the assignment. I was able to get as far as working through the course demonstrations, with quite a bit of difficulty, but when I got to the actual assignment, I was unable to proceed because I couldn't install the required npm command because I don't have the permissions on my device to do so.

Mentally, I struggled to understand the instructions of a lot of the course content and it took me quite a while of attempting different methods until I found something that actually worked--and that was just for the course demonstrations, and with help from my peers. While I did manage to get some of the examples to work, there was still a lot of stuff I didn't really get and that I don't think the course content covered very well, like how to open and maneuver around with Node after downloading it, and troubleshooting on my own turned up very few results. So, I was quite literally unable to do this week's assignment.

Finally, I also had issues with committing my work to my GitHub page. I don't totally understand what the issue was but when I tried to commit my work, I received an error that my page wouldn't build due to some errors in the node.js code.
