      <h1>Main Theme</h1>
      <p>My theme for this site is lo-fi space, which is sort of explained by the lo-fi playlist above. I wanted to do something sort of simple but still creative for the first week of class and I thought a lo-fi, or low fidelity, aesthetic was a good option! I wanted to include some of my other work, too, so I used a(n albiet simple) galaxy piece that I created myself as the background image, and I used elements that I learned from past personal and school projects to style the site. The other images used, the UFO and moon, are from the site ClipartKey, the playlist is by Feardog Music on YouTube, and the Secret Link (accessed via clicking the moon) is a popular random site generator that I just thought would be a fun inclusion that gave the moon more of a purpose.

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alec and I'm a junior, working towards my Bachelor's in Media Arts and a certification in Cybersecurity. I should be graduating in the next two years, maybe a year if I do classes during every semester, including summer and winter. I've been doing art for as long as I can remember (I made the background image of this site, actually) and have been crafting and customizing figurines for the past few years now. I've never professionally worked in an artistic field before but I plan to create a design portfolio this semester and use it to apply for jobs in a creative field this summer.

      <h1>What Makes Me Unique?</h1>
      <p>I've been an artist for, quite literally, as long as I remember and I love to play with different types of design, so I pick up new mediums fairly quickly. I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades of art mediums; I've done everything from traditional sketching, to painting, to customizing, to jewelry-making, to woodwork.</p>
