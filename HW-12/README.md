# Summary

For this week's assignment, I wanted to use the code we learned this week to create a casual collector game. Instead of a violent, score-based, or speed run style of game, I wanted to go for one of those relaxing endless games, likes those made to play to relieve anxiety. I explored assets before I really had an idea about what I wanted the game to look like but after finding Maaot's "Mossy Cavern" asset pack on itch.io, the idea of the player collecting potions in a dark forest immediately came to mind; the asset pack came with a little wizard character that was perfect for the idea too, so I decided to use them. I also tried to find a relaxing 8-bit playlist on YouTube to add as background music, and ended up using AlmostAppropiate's "16 Bit Study Music - Chapter 1 - The Beginning" playlist.

I created a sprite sheet for the wizard and altered their coloring slightly to make them stick out a bit more. I also altered one of Maaot's mossy platforms to fit with the original platform asset's dimensions. Along with the playlist and Maaot's asset pack, I found hello_tazzina's "Green Woods" asset pack that I used for the game's background, and VikingTabern's "Universe of Potions" asset pack for the potion collectibles.

## Issues

After I got started, this project went incredibly smoothly. I struggled very little this week, except for implementing gravity to my potions and altering said gravity after doing so.
