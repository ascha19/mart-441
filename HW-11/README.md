# Summary

Wanted to reattempt an Animal Crossing themed thing, this time a sort-of game. Want to make villager (player) go hang out with "favored" villagers while "disliked" villagers cause villager to lose life/happiness.

Villager: Rasher, Tank, Rory, Rizzo, Chester, Bruce, Ruby, Olaf, Mitzi, Moe
