# Summary

I wanted to reattempt an Animal Crossing theme from previous project this semester. In this assignment, I wanted to make a minigame of sorts, where the player is supposed to greet (and "collect") "favored" villagers while being blocked by "disliked" villagers. I wanted them to gain happiness every time they greeted a favored villager and lose happiness every time they got stopped by a disliked villager. This is the main thing I wanted to set up but if I could get this set up, I'd also like the game to restart if the player lost all their happiness and for the game to end if they greeted all the desired villagers.

Villager: Rasher, Tank, Rory, Rizzo, Chester, Bruce, Ruby, Olaf, Mitzi, Moe

## Issues

Like last week, I struggled with even making my objects appear on the canvas, although I did eventually manage to do so without not really knowing how I did so. Whenever I tried to add my other sprites, however, no objects would appear. From there, I struggled to make the player character move and because I couldn't add my other sprites, I couldn't move onto the collectable portion of the assignment because I wasn't sure how to.

A more minor issue I had were being able to use the correct font, which I found out was working but didn't appear across all browsers; it showed up on Google Chrome, but not Firefox. I also couldn't figure out how to make the objects show up as the images I set for them instead of just colored blocks.
