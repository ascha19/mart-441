# Summary

This week's assignment got off to a somewhat rocky start because I had a hard time grasping the reading and examples, but once I actually got started, things went pretty smoothly. I decided to make my viewfinder about a few different galaxies, including the names, years they were discovered, a short description, and image credit.

## Issues

I only had a couple issues this week, most of them being minor syntax errors and the mixing up of capitalization. When I first started out, one of the bigger issues I had was that my div that held all of the information wasn't showing up, but I learned that was because I had too many return commands when I was only supposed to have one. Another bigger issue that I had, that I still haven't figured out was that I couldn't get the button to center. It looks a little out of place but it doesn't affect the overall design too much, so I didn't worry about it a whole lot. The final issue I had was clicking to the next pages in the viewfinder; I had to fiddle around with it for quite a while but the solution ended up being to add a counter.
