# Summary

The first thing I did this week was copy all the code that I had done from last week's repo to this week's. I probably didn't have to do this but I like to stay organized by week, so I did it more for my own organization purposes than anything.

After that, I moved onto making the player info page. First, I had to created a new HTML page, then I made divs that held the text boxes first and last names and age, and a button to submit them; I also set up a third HTML page for the final screen of the game. Then I created all the other variables needed to make functions to create and get information from the JSON, then created said functions.
