#Summary
This week was the initial setup of a memory card game. The original idea I had was to use tarot cards but then I decided that would be too many cards to work with for the start of the project. I settled for an easier idea, the twelve zodiac constellations. I found an image that included all of them online and then I cropped the image twelve times to make each of the individual 1x1 inch cards; then I found a pink nebula image that I thought would look good with the dusky purple background and yellow font colors that I wanted to use, and cropped it down as well.

#Issues
I had several mini syntax issues that caused my code to break but other than that, this week's coding went pretty smoothly. The first of them was having an extra '{' where it wasn't supposed to be and another was not adding enough zeroes to my count variable. One other minor issue I had was that the border of my divs that held the cards were twice the width than I wanted them to be. This issue I still haven't fixed but it doesn't negatively affect the code at all, so I'm not worrying about it for the time being.
