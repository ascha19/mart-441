# Summary

The first thing I did this week was copy all the code that I had done from last week's repo to this week's. I probably didn't have to do this but I like to stay organized by week, so I did it more for my own organization purposes than anything.

After that, I moved onto making the player info page. First, I had to created a new HTML page, then I made divs that held the text boxes first and last names and age, and a button to submit them; I also set up a third HTML page for the final screen of the game. Then I created all the other variables needed to make functions to create and get information from the JSON, then created said functions. I took a break from the JavaScript at that point and went to my final screen HTML to set it up and and add an onload for it to be able to call the game's final information at the end. I went back to the JavaScript one more time to add code to the card flipping function that allowed attempts to be counted and that would flip the cards back around.

Finally, I combed through my entire code to fix any syntax errors I could find and fix them, and change anything that I didn't like before committing my final changes to GitHub.

# Issues

I did struggle with messing up a piece of code here and there but it was mainly because I mixed up the names of my functions or misspelled something. Other than that, the coding went smoothly.
